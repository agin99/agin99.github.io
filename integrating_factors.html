<h4> ODEs using the Integrating Factor Method </h4>
<p>
Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are equations that include an unknown function of a single independent 
variable and its derivatives. The equation relates the rate of change to the unknown function itself and the 
goal is to use mathematical techniques to simplify the equation form and solve for the unknown function. This 
blog will be about an analytical method that uses an integrating factor to simplify the equation into a form 
friendly to direct integration. 
</p>

<h4> Using the Differentiation Product Rule </h4>
To begin, we’ll show that an equality of the form 
$$
\frac{df}{dt} g(t) + f(t) \frac{dg}{dt} = Q(t) g(t)
$$
with \(g(t)\) and \(Q(t)\) as known functions can be solved for an unknown function \(f(t)\). The differentiation product rule allows us to rewrite the left side of the equality as
$$
\frac{df}{dt} g(t) + f(t) \frac{dg}{dt}  = \frac{d}{dt}[f(t)g(t)]
$$
where \(t\) is the single independent variable. This allows us to cast the original equality as 
$$
\frac{d}{dt}[f(t)g(t)] = Q(t) g(t)
$$
Applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus of Calculus to integrate both sides, 
$$
\begin{align}
\int \frac{d}{dt}[f(t)g(t)] &= \int Q(t) g(t) dt \\
f(t)g(t) &= \int Q(t) g(t) dt \\
f(t) &= \frac{1}{g(t)} \int Q(t) g(t) dt
\end{align}
$$
Since \(g(t)\) and \(Q(t)\) are known functions of the independent variable \(t\), this form of the unknown \(f(t)\) is solvable. 

<h4> Casting an ODE into the Standard Form </h4>
Given the above proof for finding the unknown \(f(t)\), the question becomes whether an ODE can be algebraically manipulated into the form
$$
\frac{df}{dt} + P(t)f(t) = Q(t)
$$
If we can cast the ODE in this way, the goal is to find a multiplicative factor that can be used across the entire equality, \(g(t)\), such that 
$$
\frac{df}{dt} g(t) + f(t) \frac{dg}{dt} = Q(t) g(t)
$$
for \(\frac{dg}{dt} = P(t)g(t)\). This offsets the goal to solving the differential equation \(\frac{dg}{dt} = P(t)g(t)\), which has a direct solution of \(g(t) = e^{\int P(t) dt}\). With the integrating factor, \(g(t)\), 
$$
\begin{align}
g(t)\frac{df}{dt} + g(t)P(t)f(t) &= g(t)Q(t) \\
e^{\int P(t) dt} \frac{df}{dt} + P(t) e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t) &= g(t) Q(t)
\end{align}
$$ 
This is the form required to apply our proof of solving for the unknown function \(f(t)\). Therefore, recasting the left side of our equality as
$$
e^{\int P(t) dt} \frac{df}{dt} + P(t) e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t) = \frac{d}{dt}[e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t)]
$$
the original equality can be rewritten as 
$$
\frac{d}{dt}[e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t)] = e^{\int P(t) dt} Q(t)
$$
Integrating both sides, 
$$
\begin{align}
\int \frac{d}{dt}[e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t)] dt &= \int e^{\int P(t) dt} Q(t) dt \\
e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t) &= \int e^{\int P(t) dt} Q(t) dt \\
f(t) &= \frac{1}{e^{\int P(t) dt}} \int e^{\int P(t) dt} Q(t) dt
\end{align}
$$

<h4> Conclusion </h4>
By using an integrating factor \(g(t)\), often written as \(µ(t)\), we’ve solved the ODE for the unknown function \(f(t)\). Therefore, if dealing with an ODE that can be algebraically cast as 
$$
\frac{df}{dt} + P(t)f(t) = Q(t)
$$
we can use the method of integrating factors to solve for the unknown function \(f(t)\). Q.E.D
