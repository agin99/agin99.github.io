<h1 style="text-align: left;">2/16/25: Solving ODEs with integrating factors</h1>
<div style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3 style="text-align: left;"> ODEs using the Integrating Factor Method </h3>
<p>
Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are equations that include an unknown function of a single independent 
variable and its derivatives. The equation relates the rate of change to the unknown function itself and the 
goal is to use mathematical techniques to simplify the equation form and solve for the unknown function. This 
blog will be about an analytical method that uses an integrating factor to simplify the equation into a form 
friendly to direct integration. 
</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Using the Differentiation Product Rule </h3>
<p>
To begin, we’ll show that an equality of the form 
$$
\frac{df}{dt} g(t) + f(t) \frac{dg}{dt} = Q(t) g(t)
$$
with \(g(t)\) and \(Q(t)\) as known functions can be solved for an unknown function \(f(t)\). The product rule 
for differentiation allows us to rewrite the left side of the equality as
$$
\frac{df}{dt} g(t) + f(t) \frac{dg}{dt}  = \frac{d}{dt}[f(t)g(t)]
$$
where \(t\) is the single independent variable. Using the product rule, we cast the original equality as 
$$
\frac{d}{dt}[f(t)g(t)] = Q(t) g(t)
$$
Finally, applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus of Calculus to integrate both sides, 
$$
\begin{align}
\int \frac{d}{dt}[f(t)g(t)] &= \int Q(t) g(t) dt \\
f(t)g(t) &= \int Q(t) g(t) dt \\
f(t) &= \frac{1}{g(t)} \int Q(t) g(t) dt
\end{align}
$$
Since \(g(t)\) and \(Q(t)\) are known functions of the independent variable \(t\), the unknown \(f(t)\) is a 
solvable through integration by parts.
</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Casting an ODE into the Standard Form </h3>
<p>
Given the above proof for finding the unknown \(f(t)\), the question of whether or not to use the integrating 
factor method becomes a dependent on if the ODE can be algebraically manipulated into the form
$$
\frac{df}{dt} + P(t)f(t) = Q(t)
$$
If we can cast the ODE in this way, the goal is to find a multiplicative factor that can be used across the entire 
equality, \(g(t)\), such that 
$$
\frac{df}{dt} g(t) + f(t) \frac{dg}{dt} = Q(t) g(t)
$$
for \(\frac{dg}{dt} = P(t)g(t)\). This further offsets the goal to one of solving the differential equation \(\frac{dg}{dt} = P(t)g(t)\), 
which has a solution of \(g(t) = e^{\int P(t) dt}\). With the integrating factor, \(g(t)\), we may write the algebraically manipulated
equality as 
$$
\begin{align}
g(t)\frac{df}{dt} + g(t)P(t)f(t) &= g(t)Q(t) \\
e^{\int P(t) dt} \frac{df}{dt} + P(t) e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t) &= e^{\int P(t) dt} Q(t)
\end{align}
$$ 
This is the form required to apply our proven method of solving for the unknown function \(f(t)\). Therefore, recasting 
the left side of our equality as
$$
e^{\int P(t) dt} \frac{df}{dt} + P(t) e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t) = \frac{d}{dt}[e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t)]
$$
the original equality can be rewritten as 
$$
\frac{d}{dt}[e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t)] = e^{\int P(t) dt} Q(t)
$$
Integrating both sides, 
$$
\begin{align}
\int \frac{d}{dt}[e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t)] dt &= \int e^{\int P(t) dt} Q(t) dt \\
e^{\int P(t) dt} f(t) &= \int e^{\int P(t) dt} Q(t) dt \\
f(t) &= \frac{1}{e^{\int P(t) dt}} \int e^{\int P(t) dt} Q(t) dt
\end{align}
$$

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Conclusion </h3>
<p>
By using an integrating factor \(g(t)\), often written as \(µ(t)\), we’ve solved the ODE for the unknown function \(f(t)\). Therefore, if dealing with an ODE that can be algebraically cast as 
$$
\frac{df}{dt} + P(t)f(t) = Q(t)
$$
we can use the method of integrating factors to solve for the unknown function \(f(t)\). Q.E.D
